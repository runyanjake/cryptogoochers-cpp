# cryptogoochers-cpp
A C++ port of https://github.com/runyanjake/cryptogoochers. Still will use selenium for headless/automated browsing, sqlite3 for database storage. Since NLTK is python specific will most likely look for another NLP library or forego it on this port. Will probably use Tensorflow too.
